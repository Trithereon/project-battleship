# Brainstorm

- Ok the focus is practicing test driven development TDD, so I need to definitely start by writing tests and then turning them green, one little thing at a time. I guess I'll be focusing on writing many pure functions and then refactor.
- It was recommended in the lessons to do...
  - Write test > Write function to pass the test > Continue until all requirements of the project are met > refactor the code, to make it cleaner or more DRY, avoid redundancy
